Data used for paper Multi-component maintenance optimization: A stochastic programming approach

./main.py: The main file used for generating the data.zip's data. The lifetime generation seed is the same with the one we used in the experimenet.
			In fact, all algorithms/methods' data are using the same lifetime generation seed.
./data.zip: The sampled data files.
