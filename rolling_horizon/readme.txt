Use two-stage model and rolling horizon to approximate the multi-stage model
and two benchmarks

Folder structure:
=================
./benchmark:		Benchmark 1 in the paper.
./benchmark_nN:		Benchmark 2 in the paper.
./multi-stage:		Model 1 in the paper. The global optimum of both benchmarks and rolling horizon algorithms.
./roll_PH_Heuristic:Model 2 + rolling horizon.
